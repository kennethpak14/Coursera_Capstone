# Venue Analysis in SF Neighborhoods
Hey!

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and full write-up of the report for a Capstone project. There is also a blogpost I wrote on the analysis that gives a higher level overview of the data [here](https://medium.com/@kennethpak/venue-analysis-of-sf-neighborhoods-3fa3b5c02dee?sk=65122611b10bf4248c782b8be7878e8f). 

The .ipynb file (containing all the code) is best viewed on Jupyter Notebook, but it can also be viewed directly through Github (minus the Folium map).

The report write-up can be downloaded directly from this repository, and opened on Microsoft Word.

    "When a company or individual is looking to open a new store, location plays a strong role in the early success of a budding enterprise. While outstanding products and quality service are an essential part in retaining customers, with an unfavorable location, the venue might not gain enough traction for the business to start. The location of a venue determines a large portion of the visibility, foot traffic, and potential competitors.\n",
